# Linear Algebra Assignment: Determinants, Invertibility, and Surface Area

This project implements Python functions to explore key linear algebra concepts, including determinants, matrix invertibility, and the calculation of surface areas of 3D shapes composed of triangular faces. Additionally, the project includes a 3D visualization of the surface area for better understanding.

## Introduction

The assignment is divided into two parts:

1. **Determinants and Invertibility**:
   - Implement recursive functions to calculate the determinant of a matrix.
   - Check if a matrix is invertible based on its determinant.
   
2. **Surface Area of 3D Shapes**:
   - Compute the area of a triangular face using the cross product of edge vectors.
   - Calculate the total surface area of a 3D object made up of several triangular faces.
   - Visualize the 3D object using Matplotlib.

## Requirements

To complete this assignment, you need:
- **Python 3.6+**
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`

You can install the necessary libraries using the following:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
